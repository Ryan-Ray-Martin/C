Some reminders for future assigments
- Make a comment on if the author's name and date is at the top of the file. Points will be taken off in the future but not this time.
- Try to make a commit at the beginning, middle and end of the assignment. Or you can try make a commit after finishing each milestone. Points will be taken off if there is just one commit for the whole assignment or the commit messages are not meaningful. Not meaningful example: "upload a2", "assigment2". 
- Be sure to follow the code standards.
