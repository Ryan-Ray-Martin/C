I would say this assignment took about 20 hours to complete, which is about average for all of Dr. Slaughter's classes. 20 hour homework assignments like this one are okay because they do not interfere with your obligations outside of school; rather, they challenge you to find answers, but there are not too many answers to find. I enjoy learning how to code in C, so this class has been interesting.  

Also, the magic code is DEADBEEF.
