  Printing Binary Nodes in Ascii
  Here we are not going to discuss what binary trees are (please refer this, if you are looking for binary search trees), or their operations but printing them in ascii.
  The below routine prints tree in ascii for a given Node representation which contains list of nodes, and node structure is this
      struct Node
          {
                Node * left, * right;
                      int element;
                          };
                          This pic illustrates what the below routine does on canvas..
                          ascii tree
                          Here is the printing routine..
